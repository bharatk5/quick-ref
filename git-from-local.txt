Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
$ git init


Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
$ git add .


Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
$ git commit -m "First commit"


Create a new repository on GitHub.
At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click to copy the remote repository URL.


In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote add origin <remote repository URL>


# Verifies the new remote URL
$ git remote -v


Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub if there is a remote branch called master (or main if that's what you're using)
$ git push origin master


Create local branch first by
$ git branch -m <new_name>


Push add new branch called <new_name>
$ git push origin -u <new_name>


#CAN FORCE PUSH IF NEEDED
Make sure you are not overwriting anything on the remote. Else you may get error like "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally". You can then force push local git folder to it by overriding with your changes using:
$ git push origin -u -f <new_name>
